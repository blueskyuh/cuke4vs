# cuke4vs
Cuke4vs is a [Cucumber](http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber) language pack for Visual Studio. Currently it provides syntax highlighting for Cucumber feature files.

### Goal
The goal is to integrate with [Cuke4Nuke](http://wiki.github.com/richardlawrence/Cuke4Nuke) by providing intellisense for existing step definitions and jumping to the source of these step definitions.

### How to install
Go to the download section, install the latest MSI and you're done!

###### NOTE
For some reason, the installation progress seems to halt for about 30 seconds, but after that it's ready instantly.

### Examples
####Intellisense (Ctrl-Space) for Cucumber keywords or step definitions:
![Jump to definition](http://github.com/henritersteeg/cuke4vs/raw/master/doc/screenshots/steps.png "Show steps")

####Jump to step definition (F12):
![Jump to definition](http://github.com/henritersteeg/cuke4vs/raw/master/doc/screenshots/definition.png "Jump to step definition")
